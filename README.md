# About the test

The test consist in obtain the graph representation of a family tree for the list in a JSON file

  - The code must be written in HTML5, CSS3 and plain Javascript (no frameworks nor libraries)
  - The page must present the graph as SVG boxes or paths linked by lines

### Tech

In this project, various tools and technologies were used, the purposes of which will be explained below:

* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) - The standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

### Development

The application was a huge and very interesting challenge, that allows various and complex solutions

It took almost 6 hours to develop the result that you can see in the `main` branch [accord to WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/@5f919ea9-8377-4663-abc4-0c1d3a8fd709/projects/jxfxxnllij?start=2021-04-04&end=2021-04-10), and although it is a functional version, it does not meet all the requirements.

However, I want to continue developing the application until it is complete, so I'll keep uploading commits where I finish the challenge without libraries.
### Todos

 - Implement dinamic lecture of JSON
 - Set family levels accord to JSON data
